## Description
A proposal for a binary malware classifier using the pre-trained PalmTree model. This paper is only a proposal due to 
the last minute realization that I need a commericial Binary Ninja license to run code as is. I am cuurently exploring
alternative open-source tools to use in place of Binary Ninja. 

Details can be found in [this paper](https://github.com/JaydenPal). 

The repo for the pre-trained model 'PalmTree' can be found [here](https://github.com/palmtreemodel/PalmTree/tree/master)
which contains the source code for the model as well as refernece to the associated research paper.
