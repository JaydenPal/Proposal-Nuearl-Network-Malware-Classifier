## Description
A proposal for a binary malware classifier using the pre-trained PalmTree model. This paper is only a proposal due to 
the last minute realization that I need a commericial Binary Ninja license to run code as is. I am cuurently exploring
alternative open-source tools to use in place of Binary Ninja.

The collab notebook file "malware-classifier-collab.ipynb" is the only file necessary to download. The notebook
has dedicated code to set up the environment and install dependencies (init.sh). Naturally, it is meant to be ran
in google collab. The V100 GPU runtime was used during development.

Details can be found in [this paper](https://jaydenpalacios.me/Palacios-Vo-Manishimwe.pdf). 

The repo for the pre-trained model 'PalmTree' can be found [here](https://github.com/palmtreemodel/PalmTree/tree/master)
which contains the source code for the model as well as reference to the associated research paper.
